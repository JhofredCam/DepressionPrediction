# Student Depression Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to **detect early signs of depression in students** using machine learning techniques. Mental health issues, particularly depression, are increasingly prevalent among students due to academic pressure, financial stress, and other lifestyle factors. Early identification can provide timely interventions, improving student well-being and academic performance.

By analyzing various factors such as study satisfaction, dietary habits, and work-study balance, our model predicts the likelihood of a student experiencing depression. This project was developed as part of the **Inteligencia Artificial - Explorador** course by **Talentotech**.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Student Depression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-depression-dataset/)
- **Variables Used:**
  - Age
  - Academic Pressure
  - Study Satisfaction
  - Dietary Habits
  - Suicidal Thoughts
  - Work/Study Hours
  - Financial Stress
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Ordinal Encoding applied to `Dietary Habits`
  - Label Encoding applied to `Suicidal Thoughts`

## Technologies Used
🚀 **Notebook:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, XGBoost, Seaborn, Matplotlib, KaggleHub  
⚡ **Backend:** FastAPI  
🎨 **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS

💡 **Why Gradient Boosting?**
We selected **Gradient Boosting** as our final model due to its **lower false negative rate** compared to other models. Since this project deals with **student depression detection**, minimizing false negatives is crucial—missing a case of depression could have serious consequences.

Although XGBoost had a slightly higher F1 score and accuracy, Gradient Boosting performed similarly while offering:
✅ Better control over overfitting  
✅ Improved interpretability  
✅ A more balanced trade-off between precision and recall for a sensitive application like mental health prediction
